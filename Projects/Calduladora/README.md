# Calculator Project

This project is a simple web-based calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features a clean and intuitive user interface designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- Clear and intuitive user interface.
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the calculator's interface. The styling is defined in [`estilo.css`](Projects/Calduladora/css/estilo.css).
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the calculator's functionality. The logic is contained in [`calculadora.js`](Projects/Calduladora/js/calculadora.js).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and navigate to the `Calculadora` directory. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the calculator.

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Yuzu02/Front-Resources.git
 cd Projects/Calduladora
 open index.html
```

## How It Works

The calculator's interface is built using HTML and styled with CSS. The JavaScript file calculadora.js contains functions to handle user input, perform calculations, and update the display.

Users can click on the buttons to input numbers and operations. The result is displayed on the screen after pressing the equals button or completing an operation.
